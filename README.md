# Multiple Linear Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook template for performing multiple linear regression, which allows for the modeling of relationships between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to training and evaluating a multiple linear regression model using a startup dataset.

## Notebook

### Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb

This notebook covers:
- Importing necessary libraries
- Loading the dataset
- Encoding categorical data
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
- Training the Multiple Linear Regression model on the training set
- Predicting the test set results

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiple-linear-regression.git
    ```

2. **Open the notebook:**
    - You can open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Usage

This template can be used as a starting point for implementing multiple linear regression on your datasets. Simply modify the code to fit the specific requirements of your project.

## Acknowledgments

- The initial template was automatically generated by Google Colab.
